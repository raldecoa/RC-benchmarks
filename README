RC_generator.pl -- RC (Relaxed Caveman) benchmarks generator
----------------------------------------------------------------------

RC_generator.pl is a free, open source script for creating RC benchmarks
to test network community detection algorithms.

See references below for more information about the Relaxed Caveman benchmarks [1,2],
Pielou's Index [3,4] and some works where RC benchmarks have been used [4-7].

Files
=====

In this distribution you will find the following files:

README			- This file
RC_generator.pl		- Generates the starting point of a RC benchmark
			  (the initial communities that are represented by isolated cliques)
RC_shuffler.pl		- Degrades the RC generated network by rewiring and removing links
			  (if no link removal is desired, please comment line 39 of the code)
gpl.txt			- Description of the license



Example
=====

Pipeline:

./RC_generator.pl -n 512 -c 16 -p 0.8      # Generates a network of 512 nodes composed of 16
		     	       	  	   # isolated cliques, with a Pielou's Index of PI=0.8 

./RC_shuffler.pl RC_PI-0.8.pairs	   # Shuffles and removes links from the network
		 			   # generated with the previous command at different
					   # steps (default from 10% to 90%)

Output files
=============

The execution of the script of RC_generator.pl creates the following files:

- RC_PI-0.8.pairs    	    # Network of isolated cliques. In this case with a PI=0.8
- RC_PI-0.8.comm	    # Assigned communities for each node

The execution of the script of RC_shuffler.pl creates the following files:

- RC_PI-0.8_m0.pairs 	    # 
- RC_PI-0.8_m10.pairs 	    # file_mX.pairs
- .			    # Networks with a X% of degradation, 
- .			    # where a X% of the original links have been removed
- .			    # and a X% of the remaining are rewired
- RC_PI-0.8_m90.pairs 	    #
